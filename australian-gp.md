**History**

As has become tradition, the Albert Park street circuit in Melbourne, Victoria will play host to the first round of the 2017 Formula 1 season. The first ever World Championship Australian Grand Prix was held in 1985 on the Adelaide Street Circuit. For 1996, the Australian GP was moved to Melbourne, where it has stayed ever since.

Last year saw the introduction of the elimination-style qualifying format. This format turned out to be a disaster and it was consigned to the scrapheap after just two races. The qualifying session - one of the worst in recent memory - eventually saw Lewis Hamilton claim the first pole position of the year. In the race, a bad start from both the Mercedes drivers saw Sebastian Vettel take the lead, but Alonso's monstrous crash with Haas' Esteban Gutierrez brought out a red flag and the race was neutralized. In an error characteristic of their 2016 season, Ferrari opted for the wrong strategy, eventually handing the race win to Nico Rosberg and Mercedes.

For 2017 there has been once again a major change in regulations. The Australian GP will serve as the first true indicator of the pace of this next generation of single seaters, tipped to be three seconds faster a lap than their predecessors. As the upgraded V6 Turbo engines roar into life, all eyes will be on defending champions Mercedes. The jury is still out on how close the competition will have drawn to the silver arrows; but already many have tentatively suggested that Scuderia Ferrari may be able to mount a title challenge. Cynics maintain, however, that we will once again see a championship dominated by the German marque, where midfield graduate Valtteri Bottas will be eager to prove his suitability for the Mercedes drive. We'll only truly find out when the red lights go out on the 26th of March!

**Where to watch?**

An extensive list of official F1 broadcasters can be found [on the /r/formula1 wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/index#wiki_where_to_watch). Unfortunately, watching F1 on free to air is mostly a thing of the past. But for UK viewers at least, highlights of the first race of the season can be found on Channel 4.

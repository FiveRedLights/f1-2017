**History**

As has become tradition, the Albert Park street circuit in Melbourne, Victoria will play host to the first round of the 2017 Formula 1 season. The first ever F1 Australian Grand Prix was held in 1985 in Adelaide. In 1996, the Australian GP moved on to Melbourne, where it has since then stayed. 

Last year saw the introduction of the knock-out qualifying format. This format turned out to be a disaster and it was scrapped two races later. This qualifying session, which was the worst in recent memory, was eventually won by Lewis Hamilton. In the race, a bad start from both the Mercedes drivers saw Sebastian Vettel take the lead, but Alonso's heavy crash brought out a red flag and the race was neutralized. In what would become true 2016 Ferrari style, Ferrari opted for the wrong strategy, eventually handing the race to Nico Rosberg and Mercedes.

For 2017 there has been once again a major change in regulations. Will Mercedes finally have to fight other teams for their title? Or will we once again see a championship dominated by Mercedes 1-2's? We'll find out on the 26th of March!

**Where to watch?**

An extensive list of official F1 broadcasters can be found [on the /r/formula1 wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/wiki/index#wiki_where_to_watch). Unfortunately, watching F1 on free to air is mostly a thing of the past. But for UK viewers at least, highlights of the first race of the season can be found on Channel 4.

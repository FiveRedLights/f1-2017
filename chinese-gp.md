**Background**

Round two of the 2017 Formula One World Championship will be held at the 5.451 km long Shanghai International Circuit in the megacity of Shanghai, which with a population of 24 million is the most populous city proper in the world. Sometimes critiqued as a tilkedrome, since 2004 the track has nonetheless symbolised the expansion of Formula One's global reach in the 21st century. The track record remains that set during the very first Grand Prix weekend held at the Chinese track. Michael Schumacher's record lap, a 1:32.238, was set behind the wheel of a Ferrari F2004; one of the fastest Formula 1 cars ever to grace asphalt.

Besides a retirement at Monaco, the 2004 Chinese Grand Prix was the only non-points finish for Schumacher that year. Since that inaugural event, China has developed something of a reputation for unpredictability. Following a year-long championship battle with Alonso, it was the scene of Schumacher's final F1 victory in 2006. In 2007, the then-rookie Lewis Hamilton threw away his chances at becoming the first driver in history to be world champion in their first season of top-flight single seater racing. The young Brit [beached his silver McLaren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOIxQP5PUSM) in the gravel at the pitlane entrance - an embarassing error which ultimately ceded the championship to Raikkonen in a Ferrari.

In 2009, the Chinese Grand Prix was held for the first time in April, after five years as a autumnal event. It was the only race in the early-half of the 2009 season not to be won by Button in his legendary Brawn.

The 2010 Chinese Grand Prix saw a masterful wet-weather drive by Button, cementing his reputation as one of the sport's greatest all-weather racers. Although Canada 2011 may be more famous, Button himself cites his victory in China as his greatest ever. Two years later, the 2012 Chinese GP was the first of many victories for the modern incarnation of the Mercedes F1 team, with Rosberg taking the W02 to a convincing win.

Like F1 as a whole, only silver cars have graced the top step of the podium in China during the hybrid era. However, 2016 saw a chink appear in the German marque's armour, with Vettel and Kvyat taking second and third in spite of the infamous 'torpedo' [incident](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WPWQi-2DFU) at the first corner. Hamilton's notable absence from the podium was a consequence of a first corner collision from which he struggled to recover through the midfield. The reigning world champion was widely criticised for his performance at this race, with esteemed driver-turned-commentator Martin Brundle stating at one point "That is quite possibly the worst lap I have seen Lewis Hamilton drive in a Formula 1 car". Many cite this race as one of the first prominent examples of the Mercedes' supposed inability to follow other cars closely.

As for the track itself, the Shanghai International Circuit is notable for its long straights and frustrating technical corners, particuarly the tightening-radius complex from turns 1 through 4. Built at enormous expense, the majority of the spectators for the race will sit in the large grandstand along the main straight, above which the iconic twin bridges are situated. Expect many moves to be made down the back straight, which is the longest in Formula 1 and involves up to 20 seconds at full throttle.

Entering this event, F1 fans and insiders alike await to see if the pace of the Ferrari in Melbourne was too good to be true. With more overtaking and more action expected than at Albert Park, it seems certain that the upcoming Chinese Grand Prix will be a bellweather for the season ahead. When the lights go out, it all comes down to one question. Red or Silver?

# Collaborative Editing: 2017 Formula 1

Welcome to the /r/FiveRedLights collaborative editing repository for the 2017 Formula 1 Season.
Here you can help create event posts for upcoming Grands Prix.
You may want to contribute useful links, great videos, data tables, or anything else that will serve as an event primer for the reader.

All contributions are valued - so please feel free to make grammar or spelling corrections!
All contributors will be mentioned by username in the final post.
By default we will link to your github account page, but if you would prefer us to link to a
Reddit account, Twitter profile or personal website, just include it in your commit message and we'll handle the rest.

Please don't tag your contributions with a name or username, however (i.e. 'Event History by user123').
This is a collaborative effort after all, and any changes you do make may be improved by other users.

To make a change, click on the markdown (.md) file for the relevant Grand Prix and click the pencil icon to edit it.
The syntax is effectively the same as that used in reddit posts.
Then, you can make your changes, and propose them. Please write a good commit message to make it easier for us to see what you've
contributed to the file.

If you are familiar with git, you can of course fork this repository to a local copy and make pull requests from there.

Thanks for your contributions!
